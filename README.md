# Calculator

This is a calculator which can perform basic operations i.e. add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It was created during my learning curve in TOP (The Odin Project). 

Things I learned:<br>
-Deep understanding of the difference of addEventListener and onclick, onmouseover, etc.<br>
-Deep understanding of grid formatting<br>
-Improved CSS styling<br>
-How JS computes (this came during handling of decimals, read through the web why 0.1 + 0.2 doesn't show the desired output)<br>
-Acquired an increase in awareness of the UX of the pages that I developed and will develop in the future<br>
-Handling of overflow<br>
-Assigning of changing variables to use for logic<br>
