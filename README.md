# Calculator

This is a calculator which can perform basic operations i.e. add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It was created during my learning curve in TOP (The Odin Project). 

Things I learned:
-Deep understanding of the difference of addEventListener and onclick, onmouseover, etc.
-Deep understanding of grid formatting
-Improved CSS styling
-How JS computes (this came during handling of decimals, read through the web why 0.1 + 0.2 doesn't show the desired output)
-Acquired an increase in awareness of the UX of the pages that I developed and will develop in the future
-Handling of overflow
-Assigning of changing variables to use for logic
